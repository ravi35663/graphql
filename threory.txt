// Learning Graphql
Graphql:
    -> Graphql is a Query language
    -> 
        Query{
            books{
                title,
                author,
                price
            }
        }
    -> Alternative to using  RESTApi
    -> Graphql is good for fetching needed data .
    -> Graphql provide nested query data
        e.g. 
            Query{
                course(id:1){
                    id,title,price
                    author{
                        name,
                        id,
                        courses{
                            id,
                            title,
                            thumbnail
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
    -> if you want to fetch nested data from different resources then you have to connect them at the server.
